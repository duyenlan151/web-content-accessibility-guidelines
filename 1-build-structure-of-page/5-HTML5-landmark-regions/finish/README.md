# 5. Add HTML5 Landmark Regions
Landmark regions are an accessibility feature that help identify the high-level regions of a page for screen reader users. Think of these elements as way points which allow users to navigate to (or avoid) content.

## Activity
1. Add the navigation landmarks header, footer and main to the HTML

## Solution
`<header>`, `<footer>` and `<main>` elements have been added to the page:
* `<header>` contains the top navigation links
* `<main>` contains the content body
* `<footer>` contains the footer links including the subscription component

Using the HTML5 landmark regions makes the HTML easier to read with less reliance on `DIV` elements in addition to providing navigational landmarks for screen reader users.
