# 6. Avoid An Artificial Tabindex
Every interactive element on a webpage receives keyboard focus when the user presses the tab key. That is unless the attribute `tabindex` is added to elements. When the value of `tabindex` is artificially altered and used incorrectly it causes many headaches.

## Activity
1. Remove the artificial `tabindex` attribute on all the footer elements and observe the before and after effects<p>
_Hint: use the keyboard to tab through the content to find which elements receive focus in an order which is different to how they are displayed_

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
