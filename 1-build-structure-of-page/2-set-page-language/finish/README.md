# 2. Set The Page Language
A language code helps screen reader and other assistive technology users identify text content and announce specific words and phrases correctly. When a language code isnâ€™t specified, the page language will be inferred from the screen readers default setting.

## Activity
1. The HTML has no default language applied, provide a global language which is applied to the whole page<p> _Hint: the page is written in Australian English_

## Solution
* The `<html>` element has the attribute `lang` added with a value of **en-au** (Australian English)

### Code
```html
<html lang="en-au">
```
