# 2. Set The Page Language
A language code helps screen reader and other assistive technology users identify text content and announce specific words and phrases correctly. When a language code isnâ€™t specified, the page language will be inferred from the screen readers default setting.

## Activity
1. The HTML has no default language applied, provide a global language which is applied to the whole page<p> _Hint: the page is written in Australian English_

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
