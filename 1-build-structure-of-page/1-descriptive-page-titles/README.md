# 1. Create Descriptive Page Titles
A page title is one way a user can orientate themselves to a website and can be used to describe the topic or purpose of the page. Using title text can also assist a screen reader user and should give them enough information to decide whether they wish to continue reading the page.

## Activity
1. Choose a more descriptive page title as the current title is unclear

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
