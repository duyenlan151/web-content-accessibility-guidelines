# 3. Bypass Repeating Content
Page content which repeats across multiple pages is a challenge for keyboard and screen reader users if there is no way to avoid the content. If a user is forced to tab through the same set of links to reach new content every time a page has loaded in can quickly become a frustrating and fatiguing process.

## Activity
1. Add a skip link to bypass the repeating page navigation located in the header and navigate to the beginning of the "Best Picks 2020" section

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
