# 6. Use A Validation Summary
A validation summary acts as a convenient grouping mechanism where all errors are located in one region without forcing the user to tab through each control individually to see if it has an error.

## Activity
1. Add a validation summary for the whole form

## Code
* Use the validation summary fragment
```html
<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h2 class="alert-heading">Errors have occurred</h2>
<hr>

</div>
```

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
