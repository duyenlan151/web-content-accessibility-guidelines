# 2. Identify Data Formats
Providing a text description with a programmatically associated label will help all users understand what type of data is required. But if that data is required to be a specific format or in a specific sequence this also needs to be communicated.

## Activity
1.	Add constraint information to the _Last name_ label describing the maximum number of allowed characters the control accepts

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
