# 1. Add Labels To Controls
Nearly all form elements need a label. Without a label form controls that receive keyboard focus will only announce the type of control to the screen reader user not what type of data is required. When a label doesnâ€™t provide enough information describing what to enter, more errors are likely.

## Activity
1.	Programmatically associate all labels to the form controls _Title_, _First Name_, _Last Name_, _Email Address_

## Solution
* All form controls have a programmatically associated label using the `FOR` attribute of the label with the `ID` of the form control

Using the `FOR` and `ID` attributes creates a programmatic link between the label and control and ensures when the control receives keyboard focus the accompanying label is announced (when using a screen reader). An additional benefit is the increased control activation area where the label is used to focus the control.

### Code
```html
<label for="first">First Name</label> 
<input type="text" id="first" autocomplete="off">
```
