# 3. Use Semantic Elements
Semantic elements are HTML elements which provide a structure and meaning to the content on the webpage. When content is structured, it is easier for assistive technology users including screen reader users to understand content without having to add unnecessary explanations.

## Activity
1. Apply the `<blockquote>` element to all reviews

## Solution
* The `<blockquote>` is applied to all quotes on the page, the `<cite>` element within `<blockquote>` is also applied

Semantic elements provide the screen reader with metadata. Using the `<blockquote>` element may trigger the screen reader to use a different intonation or indicate it's a quote, in essence giving hints to the user the text is different.

### Code
```html
<blockquote class="text-muted">
  These sneakers are just what I needed! they have a mixture of fabrics, and provide fantastic heel support. 
  The underside however, has a hard wearing sole which becomes slippery in the rain.
  <cite class="font-size-xs text-muted">
