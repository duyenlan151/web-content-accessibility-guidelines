# 4. Add Keyboard And Mouse Focus
The often-overlooked way of navigating a website is via the keyboard. All interactions may be accessible from the keyboard, but if users canâ€™t see where the screen focus is when navigating, it makes it that much harder to know where they are on the page.

## Activity
1. Create a consistent mouse and keyboard focus effect for the navigation links<br>*Hint: this involves editing the CSS file `focus.css`*

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Alter the file `focus.css` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
