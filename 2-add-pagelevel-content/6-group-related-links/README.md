# 6. Group Related Links
Sometimes links on a page are related, they may be links in the header such as navigation or links in the footer. When a grouping mechanism is used for these links it can trigger the screen reader to announce extra information which can assist the user in understanding how the page is structured.

## Activity

## Instructions
1. Alter the file `index.html` in the `/start/` directory
1. Compare your changes against the file `index.html` in the `/finish/` directory
1. Changes are described in the [README.md](finish/README.md)
