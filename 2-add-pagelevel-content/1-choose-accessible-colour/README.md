# 1. Choose Accessible Colours
Colour contrast is really important for users with visual impairments. A colour contrast impairment can affect a user's ability to discern links, buttons or interactive elements on a page and make it difficult to differentiate the foreground content from the background if a poor contrast between colours is chosen.
